            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Motivated, eager to learn, self taught developer from The
                    Netherlands. I am an analytical programmer with a passion
                    for all things programming. I love to work in an environment
                    where knowledge is shared as much as possible, so everyone
                    gets better along the way. Receiving and implementing
                    feedback about my process and results improves my ability to
                    be valuable to others and myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges get me going, better fail twice than not trying
                    at all. Like, why do I have to tap an NFC tag to stop my
                    music, instead of just pressing the pause button? Because I
                    can, thatâ€™s why. I like to build programs around prob lems
                    that I come across during my daily life. I love to automate
                    things that definitely do not have to be automated, just
                    because I can.
