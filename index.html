            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Motivated, eager to learn, self taught developer from The
                    Netherlands. I am an analytical programmer with a passion
                    for all things programming. I love to work in an environment
                    where knowledge is shared as much as possible, so everyone
                    gets better along the way. Receiving and implementing
                    feedback about my process and results improves my ability to
                    be valuable to others and myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Challenges get me going, better fail twice than not trying
                    at all. Like, why do I have to tap an NFC tag to stop my
                    music, instead of just pressing the pause button? Because I
                    can, that’s why. I like to build programs around prob lems
                    that I come across during my daily life. I love to automate
                    things that definitely do not have to be automated, just
                    because I can.

                            Advent of Code is a yearly programming contest in
                            December, made by Eric Wastl and hosted on
                            <a href="https://adventofcode.com"
                                >adventofcode.com</a
                            >. The contest consist of 25 daily programming
                            puzzles. Each puzzle consists of two parts: the
                            first part will introduce the problem and is gives a
                            hint to how the problem can be tackled. The second
                            part will either continue building on the first
                            part, or you will meet a barrier in you approach
                            that does not cover the changed problem.

                            I have competed in both 2020 and 2021. In 2020 my
                            programming language of choice was JavaScript, for
                            2021 I switched to TypeScript with a custom
                            environment, using a forked CLI to get personal
                            input from the website.

                            Advent of Code has helped me practice implementing
                            different data structures and algorithms. It helped
                            improve my coding fundamentals and to think outside
                            of the box. An acquaintance did code reviews on the
                            more difficult problems to help me point out areas
                            to improve.

                            With a new coach at the korfball club came a more
                            analytical approach to the matches. Recording
                            matches and logging statistics about scoring rates.
                            In my opinion this was a big improvement, using data
                            easily available to influence your decisions. But
                            tallying scoring attempts and goals on a piece of
                            paper, that wasn’t my thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using Adobe XD I made a wireframe and I wrote down
                            some specifications about the application. In my
                            spare time I build out the app in Java using Android
                            Studio and sideloaded the application on my phone. A
                            couple matches later, I was able to use the
                            application to record the data. The big advantage
                            was that the app would output a CSV file that could
                            be used to visualize the data, no more counting
                            lines or furiously deciphering handwriting.
